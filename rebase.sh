# We always do a rebase to new upstream's tarball for Fedora Rawhide.

# For non-Rawhide Fedora releases, we can sometimes backport specific patches,
# if the rebase is not possible.

# This scripts automates this process.

# Since we are operating in a dist-git repository where we can't fix things with
# --force-push if something goes wrong, we need to be extra careful and exit
# immediately if something fails.
